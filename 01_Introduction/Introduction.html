# What is Causality?

---

## Causal Questions in Economics and Political Science

- Causality (因果): X causes/affects/impacts Y


- Many questions are causal!
  - How much does an additional year of schooling increase your wage ?
  - How does online advertisement affect sales of products?
  - Do mergers between firms increase product prices?
  - Does democracy cause economic growth?
  - Does higher turnout benefit Democrats in presidential election?

---

## Theoretical Models Implies Causal Relationship

- Consumers' Utility maximization:
    - Higher income leads to more consumption (all else being fixed)
    - Higher price (typically) implies less consumption (all else being fixed)


- Educational investment leads to higher income due to 
    - higher human capital (人的資本)
    - signalling effect (シグナリング)

    
- Government spending stimulates GDP by multiplier effect (乗数効果)


---

## Data Analysis to Establish Causality

- Data analysis aims to understand what is going on in reality.
    - Test whether theoretical prediction is true.
    - Determine the sign of ambiguous theoretical prediction.
    

- Data analysis starts with **description** of data.
    - College grads earn 98% more per hour than others
    - Income inequality higher now than 30 years ago
    - Health care costs growing more slowly after ACA
    - airline prices higher now than before merger wave 
    

---

## Does **correlation** imply **causality**?

- Suppose that X and Y are moving together (**correlated, 相関**).


- Examples:
  - 1: Cities with many police officers have more crimes (positive correlation).
  - 2: Those who went to college earn more money by 10%.


- Questions:
  - Does this really mean “X causes Y”?
  - Is the magnitude of the correlation equal to that of causal effect?

---

## Three possible channels 

1. Causality
2. Reverse causality
3. Third factor, or **confounder (交絡因子)**
    - often called **spurious correlation (見せかけの相関)**


---
## Three Channels in Figure

## Case: Is Avigan effective treatment for COVID-19?

- Some Japanese celebrities who caught COVID-19 report their own experience that Anti-flu drug Avigan was effective for recovery.
  - [An episode from Junichi Ishida](https://www.chunichi.co.jp/chuspo/article/entertainment/news/CK2020042302100136.html)


- Does this mean Avigan is a silver bullet for COVID-19?


- Why do we care? 
  - Side effects of Avigan, resource allocation of public funds, etc.

---

## Difficulty 1: Counterfactual (反実仮想)

- **Counterfactual outcome** is never observed 

- Even without Avigan, a patient might have gotten better.

---

## Difficulty 2: Endogenous selection of treatment

- Suppose we have data on patients who got and did not get Avigan in their treatment.

- Does comparison of those people give you treatment effect of Avigan?

- Issue: Those who get Avigan and who do not get might be quite different in other aspects. 

---

## Solution: Clinical Trial

- Collect patients and **randomly** choose patients who are given the treatment.
  - Treatment group and control group.


- Compare the outcome of treatment and control group to see the effectiveness of treatment.


- Since 2020, various institutes have been conducting a clinical trial on Avigan for COVID-19. The results have been not assuring, though.

# Case: Data Analysis during the COVID-19 Crisis

---

# Data Analysis during the COVID-19 Crisis

- Perhaps, you might have started to see data analysis in the news more often than ever.
    - `#` of positive cases each day
    - flow of people (人流) based on mobile phone location (e.g., Agoop, NTT Docomo)
    - Effective reproduction number (実効再生算数)
    - Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine from clinical trial

    
- Researchers in many fields have been conducting various analysis to tackle the crisis.


- Some examples in Economics
    - Macroeconomic analysis using SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model
    - Nowcasting (ナウキャスティング) using alternative data (オルタナティブデータ)
    - Evaluation of various policies towards the crisis. -&gt; more on later

---

# Difficulties in Policy Analysis

- 1: **Observational study (観察研究)**: 
    - Data is observation of what people actually do.
    - Unlike clinical trial, cannot randomize treatment of policy in general.


- 2: Data limitation
    - May not be able to observe what researchers need.


- With these obstacles, we still need to **draw the conclusion while clearly acknowledging its limitations**.


---

# Case: Special Cash Payment

- Special Cash Payment (特別定額給付金): 100,000 JPY for everyone.


- Question: How much did people actually spend?
    
    
- Why we care?
    - Controversial policy (both supporters and )
    - Many countries have done a similar policy.
    

- Three empirical studies on this issue:
    - Kubota, Onishi, and Toyama (2021): Bank account data
    - Kaneda, Kubota, and Tanaka (2021): Financial app data
    - 宇南山・古村・服部 (2021): Official household survey (「家計調査」)


- I will explain Kubota, Onishi, and Toyama (2021) in detail.

# Review of Conditional Expectation

---
# Conditional Expectation (条件付き期待値)

- Overview
    - We are interested in the relationship between two different variables, say `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`.
    - Conditional expectation is a way to characterize such relationship
    - Quick review of conditional expectation.

-  Reference
    - Angrist and Pischke MHE Chapter 2 and 3.
    - 奥井ら

---

# Conditional Distribution (条件付き分布)

- Let `\(Y\)` and `\(X\)` be the random variables (確率変数). 
    - Let's say `\(Y\)` is the outcome variable and `\(X\)` is the explanatory variable. 


- The probability distribution function (確率分布関数)
    - Discrete (離散): `$$P(y,x)=Prob(X=x,Y=y)$$` for `\(y\in\{y_{1},\cdots,y_{L}\}\)` and `\(x\in\{x_{1},\cdots,x_{L}\}\)`
    - Continuous (連続): the density function (密度関数) `\(f(y,x)\)` for `\(x\in\mathbb{R}\)` and `\(y\in\mathbb{R}\)`. 

&lt;!-- - Definition: **Support (台)** of the random variable `\(X\)`, denoted by `\(supp(X)\)` is the range within which the random variable `\(X\)` can take a value. --&gt;
&lt;!--     - In the discrete case, `\(supp(X)=\{x_{1},\cdots,x_{L}\}\)` --&gt;

---


- The conditional probability mass function for discrete case `$$P(y|x)=\frac{P(y,x)}{P(x)}$$` where `\(P(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}P(y_{i},x)\)`

- The conditional density function for continuous case `\(f(y|x)=\frac{f(y,x)}{f(x)}\)`



---
# Conditional Expectation (条件付き期待値) 

- The **conditional expectation** function `$$E[Y|X]=\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}P(Y=y_{l}|X)$$` for a discrete case and `$$E[Y|X]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf(y|X)dy$$` for a continuous case. 



---

## Properties of Conditional Expectation Function

- Proposition CE1 `$$E[c(X)|X]=c(X)$$` for a function `\(c(\cdot)\)`. 

- Proposition CE2 (linearity) `$$E[a(X)Y+b(X)|X]=a(X)E[Y|X]+b(X)$$` for function `\(a(\cdot)\)` and `\(b(\cdot)\)`. 

- Proposition CE3. If `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are independent, then `\(E[Y|X]=E[Y]\)`

---


- Proof of CE3 (for a discrete case): 

`\begin{eqnarray}
E[Y|X]&amp;=&amp;\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}P(Y=y_{l}|X) \\
	  &amp;=&amp;\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}\frac{P(Y=y_{l},X)}{P(X)}=\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}\frac{P(Y=y_{l})\times P(X)}{P(X)}=E[Y].
\end{eqnarray}`

Note that we use `\(P(Y=y,X=x)=P(X=x)P(Y=y)\)` by independence.



---
# Law of iterated expectation (繰り返し期待値の法則)

- Proposition CE4 (**law of iterated expectation**)$$E[Y]=E[E[Y|X]]$$

- Expectation of conditional expectation `\(E[Y|X]\)` is unconditional expectation `\(E[Y]\)`




---

- Proof for a discrete case

`\begin{eqnarray}
E[Y]&amp;=&amp;\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}P(y_{l}) \\
	&amp;=&amp;\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}\left[\sum_{l'=1}^{L} P(y_{l},x_{l'})\right] \\
	&amp;=&amp;\sum_{l=1}^{L}y_{l}\left[\sum_{l'=1}^{L}P(y_{l}|x_{l'})P(x_{l'})\right] \\
	&amp;=&amp;\sum_{l'=1}^{L}P(x_{l'})\underbrace{\left[\sum_{l=1}^{L}P(y_{l}|x_{l'})y_{l}\right]}_{E[Y|X]}=E[E[Y|X]]
\end{eqnarray}`

- Note: A similar proof for the continuous case, though it requires some technical conditions for the exchange of integrals (Fubini's theorem).



---
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- Proposition CE4' `$$E[Y|X]=E\left[E[Y|X,Z]|X\right]$$`
    - Conditional on `\(X\)`, can apply the law of iterated expectation.
    
    
- Proposition CE5: If `\(E[Y|X]=E[Y]\)`, then `\(Cov(X,Y)=0\)`.
    - We often say `\(E[Y|X]=E[Y]\)` is **mean independence**
    - Remember: The opposite is not true.


&lt;!-- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Proposition CE6: Suppose that `\(E[Y^{2}]&lt;\infty\)` and `\(E[g(X)]&lt;\infty\)` for some function `\(g\)`. Then `$$E[(Y-\mu(X))^{2}]\leq E[(Y-g(X))^{2}]$$` where `\(\mu(X)=E[Y|X]\)`.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Interpretation:  --&gt;
&lt;!--     - Suppose that we explain `\(Y\)` using some function `\(g\)` and data `\(X\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!--     - The function `\(g\)` that minimizes **the mean squared error** is conditional expectation.  --&gt;



&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Proof:  --&gt;

&lt;!-- \begin{eqnarray} --&gt;
&lt;!-- E[(Y-g(X))^{2}]	&amp;=&amp;E[\left\{ \left(Y-\mu(X)\right)+\left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)\right\} ^{2}]\\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- 	&amp;=&amp;E\left[\left(Y-\mu(X)\right)^{2}\right]+E\left[\left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)^{2}\right]\\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- 	&amp;+&amp; 2E\left[\left(Y-\mu(X)\right)\left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)\right].  --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{eqnarray} --&gt;

&lt;!-- Using the law of iterated expectation,  --&gt;

&lt;!-- \begin{eqnarray} --&gt;
&lt;!-- E\left[\left(Y-\mu(X)\right)\left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)\right]	&amp;=&amp;E\left\{E\left[\left(Y-\mu(X)\right)\left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)|X\right]\right\} \\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- 	&amp;=&amp;E\left\{ \left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)\left(E[Y|X]-\mu(X)\right)\right\} \\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- 	&amp;=&amp;0 --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{eqnarray} --&gt;

&lt;!-- Thus,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- `$$E[(Y-g(X))^{2}]=E\left[\left(Y-\mu(X)\right)^{2}\right]+E\left[\left(\mu(X)-g(X)\right)^{2}\right],$$` which can take its minimum when `\(g(X)=\mu(X)\)`.  --&gt;

# Another useful properties 

- Law of iterated probability `$$P(Y)=\sum_{l=1}^{L}P(Y|x_{l})P(x_{l})$$` for a discrete random variable `\(X\)`
- Law of total variance `$$Var(Y)=E[V(Y|X)]+V[E(Y|X)]$$`
